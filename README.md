How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  -Validation systems along with robust testing and a high overall coverage ratio help to ensure that code is both functional and secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  -User needs can be interpreted by having a thorough discussion with the client and addressing not just their needs but their wants, and their ultimate vision.  It helps to also keep the client in mind when making changes and recommendations as the most important matter at any time is client satisfaction rather than the quality of the product.

How do I approach designing software?
  -Designing software should start with the problem it is meant to solve, the resources available, and then work backwards from there.  The old saying that I follow is that "solutions are like algebra problems."  You find the qualities, the quantities, and the constraints.  Everything else falls into place once you "balance the formula" using those inputs.
